Singleton Design Pattern

-- Used only when you want 1 instance of the class in the JVM regardless how many times it gets created.

Factory Design Pattern

-- Used when there is multiple implementations for an interface and each is created based on a specific condition e.g type
-- The logic to decide which implementation to use is moved to a different class ending with *Factory "Separation of concern principle"
